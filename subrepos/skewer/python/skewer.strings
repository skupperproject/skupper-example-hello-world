[example_suite_para]

This example is part of a [suite of examples][examples] showing the
different ways you can use [Skupper][website] to connect services
across cloud providers, data centers, and edge sites.

[website]: https://skupper.io/
[examples]: https://skupper.io/examples/index.html

[prerequisites]

* The `kubectl` command-line tool, version 1.15 or later
  ([installation guide][install-kubectl])

* The `skupper` command-line tool, the latest version ([installation
  guide][install-skupper])

* Access to at least one Kubernetes cluster, from any provider you
  choose

[configure_separate_console_sessions_preamble]

Skupper is designed for use with multiple namespaces, typically on
different clusters.  The `skupper` command uses your
[kubeconfig][kubeconfig] and current context to select the namespace
where it operates.

[kubeconfig]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/

Your kubeconfig is stored in a file in your home directory.  The
`skupper` and `kubectl` commands use the `KUBECONFIG` environment
variable to locate it.

A single kubeconfig supports only one active context per user.
Since you will be using multiple contexts at once in this
exercise, you need to create distinct kubeconfigs.

Start a console session for each of your namespaces.  Set the
`KUBECONFIG` environment variable to a different path in each
session.

[access_your_clusters_preamble]

The methods for accessing your clusters vary by Kubernetes provider.
Find the instructions for your chosen providers and use them to
authenticate and configure access for each console session.  See the
following links for more information:

* [Minikube](https://skupper.io/start/minikube.html)
* [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://skupper.io/start/eks.html)
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://skupper.io/start/aks.html)
* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://skupper.io/start/gke.html)
* [IBM Kubernetes Service](https://skupper.io/start/ibmks.html)
* [OpenShift](https://skupper.io/start/openshift.html)
* [More providers](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#kcsp)

[set_up_your_namespaces_preamble]

Use `kubectl create namespace` to create the namespaces you wish to
use (or use existing namespaces).  Use `kubectl config set-context` to
set the current namespace for each session.

[install_skupper_in_your_namespaces_preamble]

The `skupper init` command installs the Skupper router and service
controller in the current namespace.  Run the `skupper init` command
in each namespace.

**Note:** If you are using Minikube, [you need to start `minikube
tunnel`][minikube-tunnel] before you install Skupper.

[install_skupper_in_your_namespaces_postamble]

[check_the_status_of_your_namespaces_preamble]

Use `skupper status` in each console to check that Skupper is
installed.

[check_the_status_of_your_namespaces_postamble]

You should see output like this for each namespace:

~~~
Skupper is enabled for namespace "<namespace>" in interior mode. It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
The site console url is: http://<address>:8080
The credentials for internal console-auth mode are held in secret: 'skupper-console-users'
~~~

As you move through the steps below, you can use `skupper status` at
any time to check your progress.

[link_your_namespaces_preamble]

Creating a link requires use of two `skupper` commands in conjunction,
`skupper token create` and `skupper link create`.

The `skupper token create` command generates a secret token that
signifies permission to create a link.  The token also carries the
link details.  Then, in a remote namespace, The `skupper link create`
command uses the token to create a link to the namespace that
generated it.

**Note:** The link token is truly a *secret*.  Anyone who has the
token can link to your namespace.  Make sure that only those you trust
have access to it.

First, use `skupper token create` in one namespace to generate the
token.  Then, use `skupper link create` in the other to create a link.

[link_your_namespaces_postamble]

If your console sessions are on different machines, you may need to
use `scp` or a similar tool to transfer the token.

You can use the `skupper link status` command to check if linking
succeeded.

[cleaning_up_preamble]

To remove Skupper and the other resources from this exercise, use the
following commands.
