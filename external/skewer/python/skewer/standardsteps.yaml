install_the_skupper_command_line_tool:
  title: Install the Skupper command-line tool
  preamble: |
    This example uses the Skupper command-line tool to deploy Skupper.
    You need to install the `skupper` command only once for each
    development environment.

    On Linux or Mac, you can use the install script (inspect it
    [here][install-script]) to download and extract the command:

    ~~~ shell
    curl https://skupper.io/install.sh | sh
    ~~~

    The script installs the command under your home directory.  It
    prompts you to add the command to your path if necessary.

    For Windows and other installation options, see [Installing
    Skupper][install-docs].

kubernetes/set_up_your_namespaces:
  title: Set up your namespaces
  platform: kubernetes
  preamble: |
    Skupper is designed for use with multiple Kubernetes namespaces,
    usually on different clusters.  The `skupper` and `kubectl`
    commands use your [kubeconfig][kubeconfig] and current context to
    select the namespace where they operate.

    [kubeconfig]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/

    Your kubeconfig is stored in a file in your home directory.  The
    `skupper` and `kubectl` commands use the `KUBECONFIG` environment
    variable to locate it.

    A single kubeconfig supports only one active context per user.
    Since you will be using multiple contexts at once in this
    exercise, you need to create distinct kubeconfigs.

    For each namespace, open a new terminal window.  In each terminal,
    set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable to a different path and
    log in to your cluster.  Then create the namespace you wish to use
    and set the namespace on your current context.

kubernetes/create_your_sites:
  title: Create your sites
  platform: kubernetes
  preamble: |
    A Skupper _site_ is a location where components of your
    application are running.  Sites are linked together to form a
    network for your application.  In Kubernetes, a site is associated
    with a namespace.

    For each namespace, use `skupper init` to create a site.  This
    deploys the Skupper router and controller.  Then use `skupper
    status` to see the outcome.

    **Note:** If you are using Minikube, you need to [start minikube
    tunnel][minikube-tunnel] before you run `skupper init`.

    [minikube-tunnel]: https://skupper.io/start/minikube.html#running-minikube-tunnel
  commands:
    "0":
      - run: skupper init
        output: |
          Waiting for LoadBalancer IP or hostname...
          Waiting for status...
          Skupper is now installed in namespace 'west'.  Use 'skupper status' to get more information.
      - run: skupper status
        output: |
          Skupper is enabled for namespace "west". It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
    "*":
      - run: skupper init
        output: |
          Waiting for LoadBalancer IP or hostname...
          Waiting for status...
          Skupper is now installed in namespace 'east'.  Use 'skupper status' to get more information.
      - run: skupper status
        output: |
          Skupper is enabled for namespace "east". It is not connected to any other sites. It has no exposed services.
  postamble: |
    As you move through the steps below, you can use `skupper status` at
    any time to check your progress.
podman/set_up_your_podman_network:
  title: Set up your Podman network
  platform: podman
  preamble: |
    Open a new terminal window and set the `SKUPPER_PLATFORM`
    environment variable to `podman`.  This sets the Skupper platform
    to Podman for this terminal session.

    Use `podman network create` to create the Podman network that
    Skupper will use.

    Use `systemctl` to enable the Podman API service.
  commands:
    "*":
      - run: export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
      - run: podman network create skupper
        apply: readme
      - run: if ! podman network exists skupper; then podman network create skupper; fi
        apply: test
      - run: systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
  postamble: |
    If the `systemctl` command doesn't work, you can try the `podman
    system service` command instead:

    ~~~
    podman system service --time=0 unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock &
    ~~~
link_your_sites:
  title: Link your sites
  preamble: |
    Creating a link requires use of two `skupper` commands in
    conjunction, `skupper token create` and `skupper link create`.

    The `skupper token create` command generates a secret token that
    signifies permission to create a link.  The token also carries the
    link details.  Then, in a remote site, The `skupper link
    create` command uses the token to create a link to the site
    that generated it.

    **Note:** The link token is truly a *secret*.  Anyone who has the
    token can link to your site.  Make sure that only those you trust
    have access to it.

    First, use `skupper token create` in site @site0@ to generate the
    token.  Then, use `skupper link create` in site @site1@ to link
    the sites.
  commands:
    "0":
      - run: skupper token create ~/secret.token
        output: Token written to ~/secret.token
    "1":
      - run: skupper link create ~/secret.token
        output: |
          Site configured to link to https://10.105.193.154:8081/ed9c37f6-d78a-11ec-a8c7-04421a4c5042 (name=link1)
          Check the status of the link using 'skupper link status'.
      - run: skupper link status --wait 60
        apply: test
  postamble: |
    If your terminal sessions are on different machines, you may need
    to use `scp` or a similar tool to transfer the token securely.  By
    default, tokens expire after a single use or 15 minutes after
    creation.
cleaning_up:
  name: cleaning_up
  title: Cleaning up
  numbered: false
  preamble: |
    To remove Skupper and the other resources from this exercise, use
    the following commands.
  commands:
    "*":
      - run: skupper delete
hello_world/deploy_the_frontend_and_backend:
  title: Deploy the frontent and backend
  preamble: |
    This example runs the frontend and the backend in separate
    Kubernetes namespaces, on different clusters.

    Use `kubectl create deployment` to deploy the frontend in
    namespace `@namespace0@` and the backend in namespace
    `@namespace1@`.
  commands:
    "0":
      - run: kubectl create deployment frontend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-frontend
    "1":
      - run: kubectl create deployment backend --image quay.io/skupper/hello-world-backend --replicas 3
hello_world/expose_the_backend:
  title: Expose the backend
  preamble: |
    We now have our sites linked to form a Skupper network, but no
    services are exposed on it.  Skupper uses the `skupper expose`
    command to select a service from one site for exposure in all the
    linked sites.

    Use `skupper expose` to expose the backend service in @site1@ to
    the frontend in @site0@.
  commands:
    "1":
      - await_resource: deployment/backend
      - run: skupper expose deployment/backend --port 8080
        output: deployment backend exposed as backend
hello_world/access_the_frontend:
  title: Access the frontend
  preamble: |
    In order to use and test the application, we need external access
    to the frontend.

    Use `kubectl expose` with `--type LoadBalancer` to open network
    access to the frontend service.

    Once the frontend is exposed, use `kubectl get service/frontend`
    to look up the external IP of the frontend service.  If the
    external IP is `<pending>`, try again after a moment.

    Once you have the external IP, use `curl` or a similar tool to
    request the `/api/health` endpoint at that address.

    **Note:** The `<external-ip>` field in the following commands is a
    placeholder.  The actual value is an IP address.
  commands:
    "0":
      - run: kubectl expose deployment/frontend --port 8080 --type LoadBalancer
        output: service/frontend exposed
      - await_resource: service/frontend
      - run: kubectl get service/frontend
        apply: readme
        output: |
          NAME       TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)          AGE
          frontend   LoadBalancer   10.103.232.28   <external-ip>   8080:30407/TCP   15s
      - run: curl http://<external-ip>:8080/api/health
        apply: readme
        output: OK
      - await_http_ok: [service/frontend, "http://{}:8080/api/health"]
  postamble: |
    If everything is in order, you can now access the web interface by
    navigating to `http://<external-ip>:8080/` in your browser.
