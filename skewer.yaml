title: Skupper Hello World
subtitle: A minimal HTTP application deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper
overview: |
  This example is a very simple multi-service HTTP application
  deployed across Kubernetes clusters using Skupper.

  It contains two services:

  * A backend service that exposes an `/api/hello` endpoint.  It
    returns greetings of the form `Hi, <your-name>.  I am <my-name>
    (<pod-name>)`.

  * A frontend service that sends greetings to the backend and
    fetches new greetings in response.

  With Skupper, you can place the backend in one cluster and the
  frontend in another and maintain connectivity between the two
  services without exposing the backend to the public internet.

  - title: Install the Skupper Network Observer
    preamble: |
      The Skupper Network Observer is an application that can be ran alongside a
      Skupper _site_. It collects application-network-wide telemetry and exposes
      it through the Skupper Console web application.

      Install the Skupper Network Observer in West
    commands:
      west:
        - run: "kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/c-kruse/b3410682956d37c73ef3f65ad00f3036/raw/b611f1b8ca02d8f3b18863a2482df130a0495f4c/manifest.yaml"
  - title: Accessing the Skupper Network Observer
    preamble: |
      In order to access the Console web application, we need external access
      to the skupper-network-observer service.

      Use `kubectl port-forward` to make the frontend available at
      `localhost:8443`.
    commands:
      west:
        - await_resource: deployment/skupper-network-observer
        - run: kubectl port-forward service/skupper-network-observer 8443:443
          apply: readme
        - run: kubectl port-forward service/skupper-network-observer 8443:443 > /dev/null &
          apply: test
        - await_port: 8443
        - run: curl -k https://localhost:8443/
          apply: test
    postamble: |
      You can now access the web interface by navigating to
      [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443) in your browser.

      The default username and password is "skupper". Authentication and other
      aspects of the deployment can be customized with the skupper
      network-observer Helm chart.

summary: |
  This example locates the frontend and backend services in different
  namespaces, on different clusters.  Ordinarily, this means that they
  have no way to communicate unless they are exposed to the public
  internet.

  Introducing Skupper into each namespace allows us to create a virtual
  application network that can connect services in different clusters.
  Any service exposed on the application network is represented as a
  local service in all of the linked namespaces.

  The backend service is located in `east`, but the frontend service
  in `west` can "see" it as if it were local.  When the frontend
  sends a request to the backend, Skupper forwards the request to the
  namespace where the backend is running and routes the response back to
  the frontend.
